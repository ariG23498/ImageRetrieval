# Image Retrieval

This repository houses the different `colab notebooks` that I had to spin up for the report on Image Retrieval for `Weights and Biases`. 

## Contents:

1. AutoEncoders for Image Retrieval: This notebook has the implementation of a vanilla autoencoder and the ways in which the latent space is tapped for the task of image retrievals.

2. AutoEncoders with Supervision for Image Retrieval: This is a dear notebook of mine. Here resides the way to penetrate into the bottleneck of an autoencoder. The bottleneck is backpropagated with a classification loss.
